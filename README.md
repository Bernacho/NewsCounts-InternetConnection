# NewsCounts - Internet Connection and response rates

In NewsCounts we looked into the relationship between the Internet connection per county and the response rates. Due to COVID-19 pandemic the Census relies more than ever on Internet responses. Using data from the American Community Survey and the 2020 Census we computed the correlation between the proportion of population with internet connection and the Census response rates.
